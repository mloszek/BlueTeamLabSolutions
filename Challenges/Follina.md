## Tools 
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
- [sha1sum](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-sha1sum-command/)
## Hints
Calculating SHA1 checksum of the unpacked file from lab is pretty straightforward. We can use the `sha1sum` program if on Linux machine or PowerShell command `Get-FileHash {file} -Algorithm SHA1` if on Windows.

We then upload the *sample.doc* file into the VirusTotal and see the results. Questions 2, 8 and 9 can be answered using the knowledge from these analysis results.
